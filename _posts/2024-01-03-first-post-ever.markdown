First post ever? Not really, but it could very well count as one of the first ones. I'm fairly new at writing and expressing my ideas, so please bear with me while I get the hang of this. I promise I will get better at it. My name is Andr√©s Rojas, and I am a software developer. Starting today, I will be releasing articles weekly about the things I learn and the things I think are worth writing down, creating a knowledge base, and helping whoever might find any of this information useful.

Cheers.
