Hello World ! Welcome and thank you for spening time here with me, I'm fairly new at writing and expressing my ideas, so please bear with me while I get the hang of this. I promise I will get better at it. My name is Andr√©s Rojas, and I am a software developer. Starting today, I will be releasing articles weekly about the things I learn and the things I think are worth writing down, creating a knowledge base, and helping whoever might find any of this information useful.

Cheers.
